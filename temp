### Android

PROS
- The ability to customize homescreen, icons and quick settings menu etc.
- Provides overall more flexible functionality.
- ChromeCast. Stream content without streaming from the device itself, with saves battery. Supported on many apps.

CONS
- Apps have too much control of the personal storage, when apps has Storage Permission enabled.
- Too much settings related to Google account (Maps, Google Assistant, Google Search etc.)
- Built-in backup in Android Oreo; earlier version of Android uses Google Drive to accomplish this. 
Neither of these provides good reliable backups, as apps needs to be at least API version 23 and actively instructed
by the developer to allow backup of app data.

Bottomline

### iOS

PROS

- Streamlined design interface between the OS itself and third party apps.
- Easy backup and restore options through iCloud.

CONS
